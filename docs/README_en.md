# PromptWorks Overview

PromptWorks is a full-stack solution focused on prompt asset management and large-model operations. The repository hosts a FastAPI backend together with a Vue + Element Plus frontend. The platform supports full prompt lifecycle management, model configuration, version comparison, and evaluation experiments, providing teams with a unified collaboration and testing workbench.

## ✨ Core Capabilities
- **Prompt Management**: Create prompts, iterate versions, organize them with tags, and retain a complete audit trail.
- **Version Comparison**: Provide diff views to quickly identify content changes introduced by prompt updates.
- **Model Operations**: Centrally manage available model services and invocation quotas to support A/B experiments.
- **Evaluation & Testing**: Expose experiment execution and metric recording capabilities on the backend, while the frontend ships with pre-configured testing panels ready for integration.

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis, Celery.
- **Frontend**: Vite, Vue 3 (TypeScript), Vue Router, Element Plus.
- **Tooling**: `uv` for dependency and task management, PoeThePoet for unified commands, pytest + coverage for quality assurance.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Backend Service**: Lives under `app/`, follows a FastAPI + SQLAlchemy layered structure with business logic encapsulated in `services/`.
- **Database & Messaging**: Defaults to PostgreSQL and Redis, with optional Celery task queue capabilities.
- **Frontend Application**: Located in `frontend/`, built with Vite to deliver prompt management and testing experiences.
- **Unified Configuration**: Uses the root `.env` and front-end `VITE_` environment variables to decouple environment-specific settings.

## 🚀 Quick Start
### 0. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL and Redis (recommended for production); for local development, refer to `.env.example` for default parameters.

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
# Sync backend dependencies (including development tools)
uv sync --extra dev

# Initialize environment variables and apply database migrations
cp .env.example .env
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

### 2. Frontend Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Launch Services
```bash
# Start the FastAPI development server
uv run poe server

# Start the frontend dev server in a new terminal
cd frontend
npm run dev -- --host
## Alternatively
uv run poe frontend
```
The backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (API docs at `/docs`), while the frontend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

### 4. Common Quality Checks
```bash
uv run poe format      # Enforce code style
uv run poe lint        # Static type checking
uv run poe test        # Unit and integration tests
uv run poe test-all    # Run the three commands sequentially

# Build production assets from the frontend directory
npm run build
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed (Docker Desktop or NerdCTL).
- **Startup**:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
- **Entry Points**: Frontend defaults to `http://localhost:18080`, backend API to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`, with database and Redis accessible via ports `15432` and `6379`.
- **Stop / Clean Up**:
```bash
docker compose down            # Stop containers
docker compose down -v         # Stop and remove volumes
```

### Service Matrix
| Service | Description | Port | Extra Info |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `postgres` | PostgreSQL database | 15432 | Default user, password, and database are all `promptworks`. |
| `redis` | Redis cache / message queue | 6379 | AOF enabled, suitable for development usage. |
| `backend` | FastAPI backend | 8000 | Automatically runs `alembic upgrade head` before startup. |
| `frontend` | Nginx-hosted frontend assets | 18080 | Configure backend endpoint via `VITE_API_BASE_URL` during build. |

> Tip: To customize ports or database credentials, update the corresponding environment variables and port mappings in `docker-compose.yml` (current sample uses `15432` and `18080`), then re-run `docker compose up -d --build`.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables
| Name | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_ENV` | No | `development` | Controls the current environment, e.g., for logging. |
| `APP_TEST_MODE` | No | `false` | Emits DEBUG-level logs when enabled; recommended only for local debugging. |
| `API_V1_STR` | No | `/api/v1` | API version prefix. |
| `PROJECT_NAME` | No | `PromptWorks` | Display name of the system. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | `postgresql+psycopg://...` | PostgreSQL connection string; must point to an accessible database. |
| `REDIS_URL` | No | `redis://localhost:6379/0` | Redis connection URL for cache or async tasks. |
| `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` | No | `http://localhost:5173` | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins. |
| `BACKEND_CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS` | No | `true` | Controls whether cookies or credentials are allowed. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | No | empty | Provide the key when integrating OpenAI models. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | No | empty | Provide the key when integrating Anthropic models. |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Required for frontend | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1` | Base URL the frontend uses to access the backend; configure in `frontend/.env.local`. |

> Tip: After copying `.env.example` to `.env`, configure `VITE_` variables in `frontend/.env.example` (to be created) or `.env.local` so build and runtime environments stay aligned.

## 📡 API & Frontend Integration
- Backend exposes endpoints such as `/api/v1/prompts` and `/api/v1/test_prompt` for the frontend. The current frontend example relies on local mock data and can be switched to live APIs in upcoming iterations.
- The prompt detail view already contains a version diff component and testing panel, enabling end-to-end validation once wired to real endpoints.
- The testing task list defaults to the new task entry point, with the legacy “Create Test Task” button hidden and wording aligned to “Create Test Task” in the new flow.

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines
1. Create a feature branch and follow the “format → type check → test” workflow.
2. Run `uv run poe test-all` to confirm the quality baseline before raising a PR.
3. Open a pull request summarizing the change scope and verification steps; keep local commit messages concise and in Chinese.

We welcome issues and suggestions—let’s build PromptWorks together!
